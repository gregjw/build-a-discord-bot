Build a Discord Bot
=========================

This is a quick and easy template for building your own Discord bot, this project relies on **[Discord.js](https://github.com/hydrabolt/discord.js/)**, if you want to extend this bot, I suggest you look at **[the official Discord API documentation](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/intro)** and **the Discord.js README**.

Before building your own bot, I highly advise checking if the bot you want to build already exists, the common places to find Discord bots are:
* [https://discordbots.org/](https://discordbots.org/)
* [https://bots.discord.pw/](https://bots.discord.pw/)
  
# Getting Started

**Step One**  
You need to  [create a new Discord Application](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me) in the developer console.

**Step Three**  
You need to add your Bot User's token as a parameter to `client.login()`, these will be used by the code to act on behalf of your registered application's bot.

If you want to avoid unneeded complexity, untick **Require OAuth2 Code Grant**.

**Go build something cool.**
